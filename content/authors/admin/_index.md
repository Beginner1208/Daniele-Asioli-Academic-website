I currently serve as Associate Professor in Agri-Food Economics and Marketing at the Department of Agri-Food Economics and Marketing – School of Agriculture, Policy, and Development at the University of Reading (United Kingdom). After earning a BSc and a MSc in Food Science and Technology from the University of Bologna (Italy) in 2002, I worked for several years as Project Manager for the Emilia Romagna Regional Government and as Marketing Manager for a food industry in Italy. During 2007 – 2008, I have been enrolled for six months as Visiting Researcher at the Department of Food, Agriculture and Resource Economics at the University of Guelph (Canada). In 2009, I received a PhD in Agri-Food Economics and Policy from the University of Guelph (Canada) and the University of Bologna (Italy). My first job out of graduate school was as Post-Doc at University of Bologna for two years and at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice (Italy) for one year. In 2013, I moved to Nofima AS and the Norwegian University of Life Science (Norway) where I served as Marie Curie Research Fellow for four years. During 2017, I have spent six months as Visiting Researcher at the Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness at University of Arkansas (United States). I am also Co-Director of my family farm in Italy as well as consultant for food businesses, governments, and other institutions.XXXXXXXX
