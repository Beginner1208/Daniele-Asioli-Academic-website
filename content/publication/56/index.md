abstract: 'Despite the rising interest in cultured meat, there remains scant information on whether consumers would value it. This study evaluated consumers willingness-to-pay (WTP) for cultured chicken and examined how information affects WTP. Using a choice experiment with a total of 571 samples, the results found that consumers are unwilling to pay a premium price for cultured chicken. The provision of information significantly enhances consumers WTP, resulting in an increase of 8.66RBM/500 g for cultured chicken. Consumers who are younger, males, have higher environmental awareness, and exhibit lower levels of new food neophobia are willing to pay more for cultured meat.'
