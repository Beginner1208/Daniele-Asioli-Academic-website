   abstract = {This study extends our current knowledge of consumer preferences for cultured meat. We explored if personality traits have a role in affecting Chinese urban consumer choice behavior for cultured meat. We performed a choice experiment (CE) and used cultured chicken breast as a case study. The results indicate that personality traits (i.e., agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness) influence consumer preference for cultured meat. Our findings provide valuable insights into the psychology of consumer preferences and attitudes that can help to effectively communicate the nature of cultured meat to the public. They also have relevant implications for cultured-meat producers, and policy makers.},
