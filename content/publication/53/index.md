abstract: 'The adoption of alternative protein sources, including precision fermentation (PF) milk, emerges as a key strategy for sustainably nourishing a growing population, offering a viable alternative to conventional dairy production. This study investigates how different information framing, on animal welfare, health, and environmental benefits, affects consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) for PF milk in Denmark (DK), Italy (IT), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Using a choice experiment (CE) that examined milk products varying on several attributes, namely type of milk technology, animal welfare information, protein type, Carbon Trust label, and price, we found that consumers generally exhibited reluctance towards PF milk. This reluctance varied by country, the type of benefits provided, and consumer traits. Additionally, latent class analysis identified three consistent consumer segments across all countries, strong traditionalists with strong preferences for conventional cow milk, light traditionalists open to alternatives but price-sensitive, and a third group with inconsistent (random) choices, highlighting both commonalities and cross-country differences in responses to PF milk. Consumer preferences for policy labelling of PF dairy products vary by country, with the US and Italy exhibiting a higher preference for these new products labelled similarly to conventional dairy products. These findings offer valuable directions for effectively communicating the benefits of PF milk products across different cultural contexts. They highlight key marketing strategies for differentiation and competition in a market crowded with conventional dairy and plant-based options. Finally, they underscore important strategic and policy implications for future labelling and regulations of PF milk.'
