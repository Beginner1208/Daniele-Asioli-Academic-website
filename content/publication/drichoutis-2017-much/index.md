abstract: 'This paper contributes in the discussion about the trade-offs between fair working conditions and
the competitiveness of local agricultural products. We use the Choice Experiment methodology
to capture the determinants of individual well-being and behavior by asking consumers to choose
between alternative states of the world that vary attributes relevant to a fair labour certification
scheme such as inflation of food prices, income of farm labourers, percentage of food imports
and unemployment rate. This allows us to estimate how consumersâ€™ wellbeing differs with
different levels of farm labourers income given all other trade-offs that consumers might face
with the introduction of stricter policies regarding farm labour. The results confirm the interest
of Greek consumers towards fair working conditions in agriculture since, holding other
parameters constant, choice probabilities are responsive to changes in the level of daily wages.'
