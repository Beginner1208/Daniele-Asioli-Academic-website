abstract: 'The main aim of this study was to investigate consumer preferences for extrinsic attributes of iced coffee, explore consumers coffee consumption habits, find new market opportunities and segment consumers based on similar products preferences. A sample of 101 consumers of iced coffee was recruited during 2012 in <styled-content style="fixed-case">N</styled-content> orway. Twelve iced coffee products combining different levels of attributes such as coffee type, origin, calories and price were presented on screen and rated according to consumers willingness to buy ( <styled-content style="fixed-case">WTB</styled-content> ). Mixed model <sc>anova</sc> , principal component analysis ( <styled-content style="fixed-case">PCA</styled-content> ) and partial least squares discriminant analysis ( <styled-content style="fixed-case">PLS</styled-content> ‐ <styled-content style="fixed-case">DA</styled-content> ) were applied to analyse data. Results show that the most preferred products for the consumer sample as a whole were low‐price low‐calorie products, while age has a significant effect on <styled-content style="fixed-case">WTB</styled-content> for different iced coffee products. Four different consumer segments based on type of iced coffee and country of production preferences were identified and discussed.'
