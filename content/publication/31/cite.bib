   abstract = {Plant-based eggs have been recently developed by food practitioners as an alternative to conventional eggs. However, there is uncertainty on how the current egg market will react to plant-based eggs, as well as lack of knowledge about product development and regulations. In this manuscript, we explored this issue by conducting in-depth interviews with egg industries and retailers, as well as with plant-based egg manufacturers. Results show that despite egg manufacturers are struggling to provide an alternative to people who do not consume eggs, they are skeptical that plant-based eggs can replicate all eggsâ€™ nutrients and functionalities. Furthermore, egg industries do not see plant-based eggs as potential competitors to their products, while plant-based egg manufactures argue that they will directly compete with eggs. Also, there is uncertainty on how to label and name plant-based eggs, which has important implications in terms of marketing and policy labeling of these new products.},
