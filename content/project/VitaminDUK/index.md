The School of Agriculture, Policy and Development of the University of Reading (UoR) is a partner in the ConsumerLab project VitaminDUK, led by the University of Leeds, (United Kingdom). The implementation of the VitaminDUK project started on 1 October 2024 and will end on 31 March 2025. The total value of the project is Â£54,414. The project aims to identify and overcome the barriers which limit the maximisation of the promotion and commercial potential of vitamin D fortified dairy products, especially for ethnic minority populations, and provide useful information for policy makers in the UK.
